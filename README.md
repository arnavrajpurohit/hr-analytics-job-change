#  HR Analytics: Predicting Job Change of Data Scientists

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding and predicting the likelihood of job changes among data science professionals. By leveraging a combination of demographic and experiential factors, we performed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and classification modeling. An interactive dashboard was also created to visualize patterns.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes demographic, educational, and employment-related information of data science professionals:

- `train.csv`: Training data (19,158 rows √ó 14 columns)
- `test.csv`: Test data (2,129 rows √ó 13 columns)
- `test_target.csv`: Target values for test data

---

## Objective

To predict whether a candidate is likely to look for a new job based on various features using classification techniques.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### üîç Missing Values
Visualizing percentage of missing data per column:

### Target Class Distribution
Majority of the candidates are **not** looking for a new job:

### Experience Distribution
Shows the distribution of years of experience:

Feature Engineering

- Cleaned `experience` and `last_new_job` columns by converting ranges and symbols to numeric.
- Encoded categorical columns using `LabelEncoder`.
- Combined train/test for consistent transformation.

Modeling & Evaluation

A Random Forest Classifier was used:

**Classification Report:**
Precision: 0.83 (class 0), 0.57 (class 1)
Recall: 0.88 (class 0), 0.47 (class 1)
Accuracy: 78%


**Confusion Matrix:**
[[2543 334]
[ 506 449]]

Feature Importance

Top contributing features (according to Random Forest):

1. `training_hours`
2. `city_development_index`
3. `experience`
4. `company_size`
5. `city`
